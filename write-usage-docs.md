Do not forget to tell people how to run the thing. How do I start the server? Which port will it be on?

A couple of (complete, with code) examples of common use cases (and maybe a screenshot?) can go a really long way to helping a developer help herself.

For libraries and similar projects such as framework integrations, include detailed documentation of what can be done with this code. Whether that documentation is here in the `README`, elsewhere in the project, or on the developer documentation site does not matter but it should exist and be clearly signposted from here.

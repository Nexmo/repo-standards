To make it easier for developers to get started, projects should have a "click to deploy" button whenever the project has a deployable thing. This might be deployed to Heroku, Azure ... or all of them!

For Heroku, we have this buildpack: <https://github.com/nexmo-community/heroku-buildpack-voice/> This Heroku Buildpack helps to set up a Nexmo Voice application, purchase a new Phone Number and Link that number to the application.

Please see this demo <https://github.com/nexmo-community/click2call> for an example of implementation.

We also add http://nexmo.dev links to deploys to help us to track use.
